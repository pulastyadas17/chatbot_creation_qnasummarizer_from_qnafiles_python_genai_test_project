âœ… Hereâ€™s how it works:
ðŸ“Œ File Upload & Text Extraction: Users can upload a variety of document formats (PDF, TXT, XLSX), and the system extracts the text using the pdfplumber library for PDFs and Pandas for Excel sheets.
ðŸ“Œ Q&A Extraction: The extracted text is processed to identify Q&A pairs, where each question is followed by an answer. This is crucial for training the system to understand the document structure.
ðŸ“Œ Question Matching with Sentence Transformers: When a user asks a question, the system uses the Sentence Transformers model to match the query with the most relevant answer from the document using semantic search. The model encodes both the documentâ€™s questions and the user query, comparing them to find the best match.

âœ… Key Features:
ðŸ“Œ Supports PDF, TXT, and XLSX document formats.
ðŸ“Œ Uses semantic search to find the most relevant answers, ensuring a highly accurate response to user questions.
ðŸ“Œ Built with Streamlit, providing a simple, interactive interface for easy usage.
